Introduction to Cloud Development in HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript (CAD101EN)

Hello, welcome to Introduction to Cloud Development with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
The second of four courses in the Professional Certificate in Cloud Application Development Foundations, this course is designed to give you the fundamental skills needed to develop cloud applications.
The World Economic Forum predicts a 34% growth rate during 2020 to 2022 in the Engineering and Cloud Computing area.
With more and more people working remotely and relying on Cloud-based apps for everything from work tasks to ordering groceries, in our increasingly contactless world, this will continue to be a huge growth area.
Emerging jobs in Engineering and Cloud Computing include Full Stack Developers, Back-end Developers, Front-end Developers, and JavaScript Developers, who all need strong skills in Cloud development.
This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of programming for the cloud; what it means to be a front-end, back-end or full stack developer, what languages you should learn and what tools you can use to help you progress in your chosen field.
The course is designed for everyone – it doesn't matter if you have a background as a developer.
Whether you're an IT person looking to develop new skills, a fresh graduate looking to make a career in cloud or web development, or an IT decision-maker, this course will equip you with what you need to get started.
So, absorb the videos, challenge yourself with the quizzes, and use the discussion forums to talk with your peers and classmates.
Finally, make sure you complete the hands-on portion of the labs throughout the course and start building a portfolio to demonstrate your skills to future employers.
Congratulations on embarking on this exciting journey.
And good luck!


Course Overview
Want to take the first steps to become a Cloud Application Developer? This course will lead you through the languages and tools you will need to develop your own Cloud Apps.
Beginning with an explanation of how internet servers and clients work together to deliver applications to users, this course then takes you through the context for application development in the Cloud, introducing front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.
You’ll then focus on the languages you need for front-end development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Finally, you will discover tools that help you to store your projects and keep track of changes made to project files, such as Git and GitHub.
